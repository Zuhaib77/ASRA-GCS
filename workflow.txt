Detailed Workflow Steps:

1. Project Initiation
   - Define project scope and objectives.
   - Assemble the development team.
   - Set up project management tools and version control.

2. Requirements Gathering
   - Conduct stakeholder interviews and surveys.
   - Analyze existing systems and user needs.
   - Document requirements in detail.

3. Requirements Review and Approval
   - Review SRS with stakeholders.
   - Obtain sign-off before proceeding.

4. System Design Phase
   - Create high-level and low-level design.
   - Define system architecture and components.
   - Prepare design review meetings.

5. Design Review and Approval
   - Present designs to stakeholders.
   - Incorporate feedback and finalize designs.

6. Implementation Phase
   - Set up development environment.
   - Code individual modules.
   - Conduct code reviews and unit testing.

7. Integration Phase
   - Combine modules into subsystems.
   - Perform integration testing.
   - Resolve integration issues.

8. System Testing Phase
   - Execute comprehensive testing (functional, performance, security).
   - Create test reports and bug tracking.
   - Validate against requirements.

9. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
   - Involve end-users in testing.
   - Gather feedback and make final adjustments.

10. Deployment Phase
    - Prepare deployment plan.
    - Migrate data and install software.
    - Conduct training sessions.

11. Post-Deployment Review
    - Monitor system performance.
    - Address initial issues.

12. Maintenance Phase
    - Establish support processes.
    - Plan for future enhancements.
    - Monitor and update as needed.

This workflow ensures that each phase is completed thoroughly before moving to the next, minimizing risks and ensuring quality deliverables.
